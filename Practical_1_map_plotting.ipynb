    "To do that, we're going to use what's called a *Jupyter notebook*: an interactive notebook which contains a mixture of text and code blocks. To run the code in a particular cell, you simply click on that cell and either click the `Run` button in the top left, or press `Shift+Enter`.\n",

    "In this practical, read through the contents of each cell and then run it to see what it does. **Make sure you understand what the code is doing - don't just blindly click through!** For your final project assignment, you can re-run and modify this notebook with your own dataset to make some nice plots for your report.\n",

    "Ok, let's get started with some Python! Python is a very easy programming language which has a lot of built in packages that can help us to do analyses. To access these helpful pieces of code, we first of all have to `import` them. To do this we just use the `import` command as shown below. The main ones are:\n",
